                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Namrata Vispute, a 3rd year Bachelor of Computer Science Engineering student at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Wadala. My primary interests lie in Python programming and UI/UX design development. I am currently focusing on core subjects, specializing in data analytics and advanced Python, to further enhance my expertise and career prospects.</p>
                <p>I have completed several trainings and workshops, including SQL & Database Management System from Cognitive Class.AI, a 7-day bootcamp on Python & AI, and Introduction to Java (Basic). I have also undertaken professional skills training from TCS iON and business management courses from IIM Mumbai.</p>
                <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in extra-curricular activities as the Creative Co-head of the Computer Society of India (CSI-VIT), the Creative Head of CESA VIT, and the TEDx Lead of Creative Design. These roles have helped me develop strong leadership and creative skills.</p>
